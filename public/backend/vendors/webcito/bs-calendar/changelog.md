### dev-main

### Version 2.3.6

2026-06-17

#### Features

- Added the new `agenda` view, a month-based list view grouped by day for appointments and tasks.
- Added a local agenda filter with reset button that shows/hides already loaded agenda appointments without calling `url`.
- Added `formatter.agenda(appointment, extras)` for custom agenda appointment rendering.
- Added `appointmentRules` for timed appointment duration validation, supporting exact durations, duration steps, minimums, maximums, and
  fixed-duration appointments.
- Added drag-resize for timed appointments in `day`, `week`, and `4day` views, with start/end resize handles that emit the existing
  `edit.bs.calendar` flow and `dragExtras` proposed range.

#### Improvements

- `agenda` participates in configured view switching, remote request data, translations, icons, navigation, and task status toggling.
- Added localized `agenda` labels to the built-in translation array.
- Agenda formatter now uses localized all-day labels and a non-wrapping compact time column.
- Agenda local filter shows `searchNoResult` when an active local search has no matches.
- Agenda local filter is reset whenever the agenda view is rebuilt.
- Drag-resize respects `draggableSnapMinutes` and `hourSlots.rules` availability, including `exclusive` and `blocked` ranges.
- Click-create, drag-create, drag-move, and drag-resize now expose `dragExtras.appointmentRules`.
- Fixed-duration appointments hide resize handles.

#### Bugfixes

- Agenda local filter now hides individual flex appointment rows reliably instead of only keeping their day group visible.
- Array-based appointment locations now render in the default info window formatter.
- Limited drag-resize hit areas to the visible resize bars so task check toggles remain clickable in timed appointments.
- Mobile touch dragging now locks native scrolling during pending gestures and activates create/move when movement starts before the
  long-press timer, making touch drag interactions more reliable.

#### Demo

- Added string and array `location` examples to generated non-task appointments.
- Added an appointment duration rule selector for no rule, 45-minute coaching blocks, and exactly 60-minute appointments.

#### Docs

- Documented the `agenda` view in setup, remote data, options, translations, icons, and localization examples.
- Documented `appointmentRules` with fixed 60-minute and 45-minute coaching block examples.
- Updated drag documentation and corrected the search request contract for `showTasks`.

#### Tests

- Added QUnit coverage for `agenda` rendering.
- Added QUnit coverage for fixed appointment durations and duration-step resizing.
- Updated global API and method view coverage.

### Version 2.3.5

2026-06-16

- Improvement: Reworked the responsive calendar shell so small and medium-width devices use a compact topnav with an offcanvas sidebar,
  while the full desktop sidebar/nav starts at the `lg` breakpoint.
- Improvement: Mobile topnav now includes the menu toggle, current view title, add/search actions, and an icon-only view switcher for
  cleaner landscape layouts.
- Improvement: The mobile offcanvas now contains the full sidebar content, including small month calendar, calendar/task toggles, and cloned
  sidebar addons.
- Bugfix: Desktop sidebar is hidden below `lg` immediately, preventing a brief sidebar flash on mobile load.
- Bugfix: Mobile offcanvas only auto-closes for clicks inside `sidebarAddons`, preserving normal sidebar interactions.
- Improvement: Mobile/offcanvas body scroll position is reset to the top every time the offcanvas opens.
- Improvement: Calendar topnav and search topnav are sticky inside the calendar area, with calendar root overflow adjusted so sticky
  positioning works correctly.
- Improvement: Month view cells on devices below `md` now use a larger viewport-aware height, making the mobile month view less compressed.
- Improvement: Removed the fixed `45px` all-day/holiday placeholder height in `week` and `4day`; empty all-day rows no longer waste vertical
  space.
- Feature: Added a compact UTC offset label above the time axis in `day`, `week`, and `4day` views, based on the local date offset.
- Bugfix: Bootstrap tooltip/popover cleanup now uses existing native Bootstrap instances instead of creating conflicting instances during
  rapid resize/rebuild cycles.
- Improvement: `hourSlots.rules` rendering now uses availability priority for overlapping rule colors, so blocking rules visually win over
  lower-priority rules.
- Files modified: `dist/bs-calendar.js`, `dist/bs-calendar.min.js`, `README.md`, `demo/index.html`, `composer.json`, `changelog.md`

### Version 2.3.4

2026-06-15

- Bugfix: Corrected time display in the hover indicator (time badge) when using non-integer `hourSlots.start` values.
- Bugfix: Fixed incorrect start time calculation when clicking on a time slot in calendars with fractional start times.
- Bugfix: Improved mobile touch dragging by locking native scrolling during pending and active drag-create/drag-move gestures.
- Bugfix: Drag-moving now refuses invalid target day columns/cells instead of visually moving appointments into disallowed days or rule
  zones.
- Improvement: Time formatting for the hover badge and click events now correctly handles minutes (e.g., "07:30" instead of "7.5:00").
- Feature: `hourSlots.rules` now accepts either a single object or an array of rule objects.
- Improvement: Each `hourSlots.rules` object can define its own `color`, resolved through `$.bsCalendar.utils.getColors`, so multiple ranges
  can be visually distinguished.
- Feature: `hourSlots.rules[].mode` now drives availability metadata: `exclusive` allows work only inside the range, `blocked` disallows
  overlapping work, and `preferred` marks preferred work time without blocking.
- Feature: `hourSlots.rules[].mode` rules now affect interactions, not only rendering: invalid click-create and invalid drop targets no
  longer fire `add.bs.calendar` or `edit.bs.calendar`.
- Improvement: Day/week/4day drag-create and drag-move now clamp to the nearest valid `hourSlots.rules` edge when leaving `exclusive` ranges
  or entering `blocked` ranges.
- Improvement: Appointment `extras` and drag `dragExtras` now expose rule availability through `hourSlotRules`.
- Feature: Added `setHourSlotRules(object|array|null)` method handling for runtime updates of `hourSlots.rules`.
- Demo: Updated `hourSlots.rules` example colors to very subtle per-mode tints for `exclusive`, `preferred`, and `blocked`.
- Docs: Updated README and demo examples for multi-range `hourSlots.rules`.
- Tests: Added `hourSlots.rules` coverage for object mode, array mode, appointment extras, and runtime updates.
- Files modified: `dist/bs-calendar.js`, `dist/bs-calendar.min.js`, `README.md`, `demo/index.html`, `composer.json`, `test/index.html`,
  `test/tests/global-api.test.js`, `test/tests/global-api.test.min.js`, `test/tests/hour-slot-rules.test.js`,
  `test/tests/hour-slot-rules.test.min.js`, `changelog.md`

### Version 2.3.3

2026-06-12

- Improvement: `hourSlots.start` and `hourSlots.end` now support decimal values and `HH:mm` strings for more detailed grid configuration.
- Improvement: Updated grid rendering and appointment positioning to handle fractional start hours correctly.
- Improvement: `highlightedHours` now uses the same time parsing logic as `hourSlots`.
- Feature: Added `setHighlightedHours(object)` method to dynamically update highlighted time slots.
- Feature: Added `highlightedHours` configuration (default: `null`) to visually highlight specific time slots in day and week views.
- Improvement: Changed `highlightedHours` logic to highlight specific time slots instead of non-working hours based on user feedback.
- Feature: Added `test/tests/highlighted-hours.test.js` to verify highlighted hours rendering.
- Improvement: Integrated `highlightedHours` with `$.bsCalendar.utils.getColors` for consistent styling without extra CSS classes.
- Feature: Double-clicking an editable appointment now triggers the existing edit flow directly without opening the info modal first.
- Improvement: Single-click appointment handling uses a short 150ms delay so double-click can cancel the info modal without making normal
  clicks feel sluggish.
- Bugfix: Prevented the info modal from opening alongside the edit modal by cancelling the second pointer/click early and removing any
  already opened info modal synchronously.
- Files modified: `dist/bs-calendar.js`, `dist/bs-calendar.min.js`, `changelog.md`

### Version 2.3.2

- Bugfix: Visibility of the drag area when creating new appointments improved (`left: 2px`).
- Bugfix: Fixed the time badge in the hover indicator (width and position on the right).
- Refactoring: Adjusted button order in the info modal (Edit, Delete, Dropdown, Close) and added spacing.

### Version 2.3.1

- Bugfix: Fixed a race condition in the demo where appointments were not shown on the first load.
- Feature: (Demo) Added task support with priority and due date in the appointment modal.
- Bugfix: (Demo) Fixed task data structure to match README requirements (nested `task` object).
- Bugfix: (Demo) Fixed task information not being correctly loaded into the modal when editing.
- Improvement: Optimized appointment rendering in month view to be single-line with text truncation.
- Files modified: `dist/bs-calendar.js`, `demo/index.html`, `changelog.md`, `composer.json`, `README.md`

### Version 2.3.0

- *Improvement: Refined task formatting to exactly match all-day appointment styles (badges) across all views.*

- Bugfix: Fixed an issue where tasks in day/week views did not show the background color correctly and appeared to deviate from normal
  appointments.
- Bugfix: Fixed an issue where appointment colors were not applied to tasks in all views.
- Feature: Native support for **Tasks** within the calendar.
- Feature: Added task-specific icons (`task`, `taskDone`, `taskOverdue`) to the defaults.
- Feature: Automatically detect tasks via the presence of a `task` object in the appointment data.
- Feature: Interactive task status toggling (checked/unchecked) directly from the calendar UI.
- Feature: Support for task due dates (`due`) with automatic "overdue" state detection.
- Improvement: Task priorities are normalized to `low`, `normal`, or `high`; missing or unsupported values default to `normal`.
- Feature: New event `task-status-changed.bs.calendar` fired when a task's status is updated.
- Improvement: Tasks are rendered with strikethrough styling and muted colors when completed.
- Improvement: Overdue tasks are highlighted with dedicated icons and styling.
- Demo: Enhanced the demo to generate random tasks and showcase the new functionality.
- Improvement: Moved the live time indicator badge to the right side to avoid overlapping with task icons in day/week views.
- Bugfix: Fixed an issue where toggling a task status triggered a redundant data fetch (AJAX request). Now it only re-renders the current
  view with updated state.
- Files modified: `dist/bs-calendar.js`, `README.md`, `changelog.md`, `demo/index.html`, `composer.json`
- Bugfix: Fixed an issue where all-day tasks were not correctly formatted as tasks (with checkbox icons and strikethrough) in day, week, and
  4day views.

- Bugfix: Fixed task checkbox icon not updating correctly when toggled.
- Improvement: The `showTasks` status is now automatically sent in all data requests (`url` or function).
- Improvement: Toggling tasks in the sidebar now triggers a fresh data fetch instead of local filtering.
- Feature: Added `onTaskStatusChanged` callback and `task-status-changed.bs.calendar` event.
- Feature: Added `onDuplicate` callback and `duplicate.bs.calendar` event (triggered via the info window dropdown).
- Feature: Added new public method `setLocale` to programmatically change the calendar locale and translations.

### Version 2.2.1

- Feature: Added new public method `setView` to programmatically change the calendar view.
- Bugfix: Optimized performance by reducing redundant calls to `getStartAndEndDateByView` during appointment processing.
- Bugfix: Fixed an issue where translations were not updated when changing the locale via `setLocale`.
- Files modified: `dist/bs-calendar.js`, `dist/bs-calendar.min.js`, `changelog.md`

### Version 2.2.0

- Feature: Added new "4day" view that shows 4 days starting from the currently selected date.
- Improvement: Generalized week view rendering to support variable day counts.
- Improvement: Added translations for "4day" view in all supported languages.
- Improvement: Added `bi-calendar-range` icon for the 4-day view.
- Improvement: Added navigation support (4-day steps) for the "4day" view.
- Bugfix: Fixed several issues in the drag & drop logic where appointments could disappear or become unresponsive during active drags,
  especially in columns with multiple entries.
- Bugfix: Fixed an indexing issue in week and 4day view where appointments were incorrectly grouped when multiple days with the same weekday
  were visible.
- Bugfix: Fixed a bug where appointments spanning multiple days would disappear in the `week` and `4day` views.
- Bugfix: Fixed a bug where multi-day appointments would disappear or cause layout issues during drag-and-drop by correctly cropping them to
  the current day's visible range.
- Bugfix: Added missing title generation for the "4day" view in `setCurrentDateName()`.
- Bugfix: Fixed missing shadow on `wcCalendarInfoWindowModal`. Added inline style fallback to ensure shadow visibility across different
  environments.
- Bugfix: Fixed an issue where calendar colors were not correctly calculated in some browsers by ensuring the temporary element is visible
  during style computation and adding fallbacks for different Bootstrap versions.
- Bugfix: Fixed visibility issues with sidebar addons (like the language select) by ensuring correct overflow settings in the sidebar
  containers and the demo page.
- Bugfix: Fixed a bug where the "4day" view was missing from the view switch if not explicitly configured in the settings (corrected
  fallback in `init()`).
- Documentation: Added documentation for `$.bsCalendar.addTranslation` to `README.md`.
- Bugfix: Fixed parameter naming in `addTranslation` to correctly register new translations.
- Bugfix: Fixed an issue in `updateOptions` where the `calendars` array was being deep-merged instead of replaced, causing color
  inconsistencies. Improved logic now merges calendar definitions by ID if the property is provided, allowing partial updates while
  preserving existing settings.
- Bugfix: Fixed an issue where `sidebarAddons` and `topbarAddons` were being deep-merged instead of replaced, which could lead to duplicated
  or incorrectly displayed addons.
- Bugfix: Fixed a bug where `sidebarAddons` and `topbarAddons` would disappear after a rebuild (e.g. during `updateOptions`) by ensuring
  them are detached before the container is cleared and preserving their references in the settings.
- Bugfix: Fixed an issue where internal translations were not updated when the locale was changed via `updateOptions`.
- Bugfix: Fixed an issue where the info modal (`wcCalendarInfoWindowModal`) remained open when starting a drag and drop operation. It now
  only closes when a real drag movement begins, staying open if an appointment is just clicked.
- Demo: Integrated `bs-datepicker` for better date selection in the appointment modal and fixed date value assignment.
- Demo: Set default language to English on the demo page.
- Demo: Updated `demo/index.html` to correctly update calendar labels and colors when switching languages.
- Files modified: `dist/bs-calendar.js`, `README.md`, `changelog.md`, `demo/index.html`

### Version 2.1.8

- Improvement: Added live hover time indicator in day/week views when `draggable` is enabled.
- Improvement: Added live start/end time labels during drag-create in day/week views.
- Improvement: Added deterministic overlap stacking by start time in render and drag-relayout.
- Improvement: Added new option `draggableSnapMinutes` (default `5`) to configure a drag snap interval in day/week interactions.
- Bugfix: Hover indicator and time labels no longer block drag interactions (`pointer-events: none`).
- Bugfix: Hover time indicator (mouse-follow line/badge) is hidden while drag-create or drag-move is active.
- Docs: Updated options reference in `README.md`.
- Files modified: `dist/bs-calendar.js`, `dist/bs-calendar.min.js`, `README.md`

### Version 2.1.7

- Bugfix: Search-mode exit now restores the previous non-search view and forces view rebuild to clear the search result /pagination UI.
- Bugfix: Month-view drag-move no longer triggers `edit.bs.calendar` for non-editable appointments (`editable: false`), including internal
  no-op/same-day move interactions.
- Improvement: Editability checks now normalize boolean-like API values (`false`, `"false"`, `0`, `"0"`) to prevent unintended edit actions.
- Feature: Added per-appointment `overlap` support for day/week view. Appointments with `overlap: true` are rendered full-width and can
  stack instead of being split into side-by-side columns.
- Improvement: Overlap stacking order now keeps the earliest appointment at the bottom and later appointments on top, including during
  drag-move live relayout.
- Demo: Added overlap examples and an overlap toggle in the appointment modal to demonstrate and test stacked overlap behavior directly.
- Docs: Updated appointment field reference with the new `overlap` option.
- Note: This feature was added based on a request from `alexlewer` in ticket **Appointment Overlap #18**.

### Version 2.1.6

- Feature: Month-view drag-move can now move appointments between day cells while preserving the original start and end times.
- Bugfix: Month-view drag-move now keeps the visual move visible while the edit modal is open; canceled edits are restored by re-rendering
  the current loaded data when the modal closes.
- Bugfix: Month-view drag-move now suppresses the follow-up day-cell click so the added modal is not opened with the current time after a
  drag.
- Improvement: Drag payload times are emitted as `HH:mm` values for form-friendly modal prefilling.
- Demo: Normalized appointment modal time values before writing to `input[type="time"]`.
- Docs: Updated README and changelog for `2.1.6`.

### Version 2.1.5

- Feature: Week-view drag-move can now move appointments across days within the visible week, not only within the original day column.
- Bugfix: Week-view appointments are now rendered only into the inner time-slot container, preventing duplicate appointment elements that
  could block drag-move.
- Demo: Re-render the calendar when the appointment modal closes, so canceled drag edits restore the current loaded data.
- Docs: Updated README and changelog for `2.1.5`.

### Version 2.1.4

- Feature: Added public `deleteAppointment` method to remove a locally loaded appointment by `id` and re-render without fetching.
- Feature: Added `added.bs.calendar`, `edited.bs.calendar`, and `deleted.bs.calendar` completion events with matching callbacks.
- Demo: Wired `delete.bs.calendar` to `deleteAppointment` in the single-calendar modal demo.
- Docs: Updated the workflow and method reference to cover adding, edit, and delete together.

### Version 2.1.3

- Feature: Added public `addAppointment` method to append an appointment to the currently loaded data and re-render without fetching.
- Feature: Added public `editAppointment` method to update an already loaded appointment by `id`; `editApointment` is accepted as a
  compatibility alias for the common typo.
- Improvement: Loaded and locally added appointments now receive a generated `id` when none is provided, allowing later local edits.
- Docs: Reworked `README.md` into a structured API reference, including add/edit workflow examples, `dragExtras` notes, local-vs.-backend
  persistence guidance, and a completeness checklist.
- Demo: Rebuilt `demo/index.html` into a single-calendar example with a clearer modal-based add/edit flow.

### Version 2.1.2

- Improvement: `dragExtras` now only contains the dragged `start` and `end` date/time values; all other appointment context remains in the
  regular `extras` object.
- Docs: Updated `README.md`, `changelog.md`, and verified the demo for `2.1.2`.

### Version 2.1.1

- Improvement: Drag-create now passes dragged start/end date and time as `dragExtras` to `add.bs.calendar` / `onAdd`.
- Improvement: Drag-move now keeps the original `appointment` and `extras` unchanged and passes dragged start/end date and time as
  `dragExtras` to `edit.bs.calendar` / `onEdit`.
- Docs: Updated `README.md`, `changelog.md`, and the demo for `2.1.1`.

### Version 2.1.0

- Feature: Added new method `render` (`$('#calendar').bsCalendar('render')`) to re-render the current view using already loaded data,
  without re-fetching appointments.
- Improvement: `buildByView` now supports an internal no-fetch render path, used by `render`.
- Docs: Updated `README.md` and `changelog.md` for `2.1.0`.

### Version 2.0.16

- Feature (year view): Optional `content` field was added; when present, it is shown in the year-view popover instead of `total`.
- Improvement (year view): Replaced badge tooltip with a popover; the popover title is now the localized day date.
- Docs: Expanded `README.md` with the year-view response contract and field reference.

### Version 2.0.15

- Bugfix: View switching is now strictly limited to entries configured in `views`.
- Bugfix: Fixed `views` merging in initialization and `updateOptions` so arrays are replaced (not index-merged), preventing hidden fallback
  views from remaining active.
- Improvement: If exactly one view is configured in `views`, `startView` is now forced to that view.
- Docs: Updated `README.md` and `changelog.md` to reflect version 2.0.15.

### Version 2.0.14.2

- Bugfix: `updateOptions` now rebuilds framework-level UI when structural options change (e.g. `showAddButton`, `search`, `views`, `icons`,
  `translations`), so toolbar updates are applied immediately.
- Improvement: Search-mode UI state is preserved more safely during framework rebuilds triggered by `updateOptions`.
- Docs: Updated `README.md` and `changelog.md` to reflect version 2.0.14.2.

### Version 2.0.14.1

- Improvement: Refined About dropdown structure and content rendering.
- Improvement: Developer and developer email are shown in one line in the About section.
- Improvement: About links use compact action text (`Open`) instead of raw URL labels.
- Docs: Updated `README.md` and `changelog.md` to reflect version 2.0.14.1.

### Version 2.0.14

- Feature: Added new `showAbout` option. If enabled, an About dropdown is rendered at the top-right of the toolbar.
- Improvement: About dropdown content is generated from `$.bsCalendar.about` and automatically renders links/email as clickable entries.
- Docs: Updated `README.md` and `changelog.md` to reflect version 2.0.14.

### Version 2.0.13.1

- Improvement: Removed `opacity-50` from out-of-month day cells in year-view small month tables to improve badge visibility/readability.
- Docs: Updated `README.md` and `changelog.md` to reflect version 2.0.13.1.

### Version 2.0.13

- Bugfix: Calendar-specific Bootstrap tooltips are now consistently disposed/removed on date and view changes to prevent stale tooltips from
  remaining visible.
- Improvement: Added centralized tooltip cleanup and applied it in the rebuild/clear flow for year-view holiday and badge tooltips.
- Docs: Updated `README.md` and `changelog.md` to reflect version 2.0.13.

### Version 2.0.12.1

- Bugfix: Fixed weekday label generation in month/small-month views for US and other negative timezones.
- Docs: Updated `README.md` and `changelog.md` to reflect version 2.0.12.1.

### Version 2.0.12

- Bugfix: Fixed date-shift issues in negative timezones (e.g., US) caused by parsing `YYYY-MM-DD` via native UTC interpretation.
- Improvement: Added timezone-safe date parsing for date-only and local date-time strings and applied it across core date handling paths (
  `setDate`, `startDate`, holidays, all-day normalization, formatting).
- Improvement: Holiday rendering now uses local date formatting instead of `toISOString().split('T')[0]` to avoid off-by-one day rendering.
- Docs: Updated `README.md` and `changelog.md` to reflect version 2.0.12.

### Version 2.0.11

- Enhancement: `getColors` and `computeColor` now support CSS variables (`var(--...)`).
- Docs: Updated `README.md` and `changelog.md` to reflect version 2.0.11.

### Version 2.0.10

- Enhancement: `appointment.link` can now be either a `string` (simple URL) or an `object` with attributes (`href`, `text`, `target`, `rel`,
  `disabled`, `html`).
- Docs: `README.md` expanded (examples and defaults for a link object); Updated Badge/CDN/Changelog reference to 2.0.10.

### Version 2.0.9.2

- Refactor modal option handling to replace `$modal` with `modalOptions` for consistency

### Version 2.0.9.1

- add class `modal-dialog-scrollable` to modal-dialog for long content

### Version 2.0.9

- Enhancement: Persistence of calendar activities (active/inactive) is loaded from `localStorage` during initialization if `storeState` is
  activated and calendars have unique `id`.
- Docs: `README.md` updated (description of `storeState`, badge and CDN link).

### Version 2.0.8

- **Bugfix**: Fixed an issue where holidays were not loaded if no `url` (string or function) was provided in the settings.
    - The `fetchAppointments` function now continues the internal workflow with an empty appointment list instead of aborting, ensuring that
      `loadHolidays` is triggered.

### Version 2.0.7

- **Design Update**: Complete modernization of the calendar UI ("Technisches Dashboard" style).
    - Introduced a new "Floating Toolbar" for navigation and actions.
    - Redesigned buttons to be neutral and adaptable to both light and dark themes.
    - Optimized the month view grid for better readability and stability.
    - **Removed**: The `rounded` option has been deprecated and removed in favor of the new, cohesive design system.
- **Performance Optimization**: The `buildByView` function now includes a state check to avoid redundant DOM rebuilds.
    - **Smart Rendering**: The calendar view (DOM structure) is only rebuilt if the view type (e.g., month, week) or the visible date range
      has changed.
    - **State Tracking**: Introduced internal `renderState` to track the currently rendered view context.
    - **Configuration Awareness**: The state check now also accounts for changes in `hourSlots` (start, end, height), ensuring the day and
      week views are correctly rebuilt when these settings are updated.
    - **Efficiency**: Actions like refreshing appointments or toggling categories now skip the heavy DOM construction phase if the view
      context remains the same, resulting in smoother interactions.
- **Bugfix**: Fixed an issue in the `year` view where refreshing appointments (e.g., toggling a calendar) would inadvertently remove the day
  cells from the DOM due to aggressive cleanup in `methodClear`.
    - The logic now correctly identifies and resets holiday markers and badges without destroying the underlying day structure.
- **New Feature**: Calendar week numbers can now also be clicked, as long as the view is activated for it. Calendar weeks are displayed in
  the month and year views, as well as in the small month view.

### Version 2.0.6

- **UI Overhaul**: Redesigned the calendar list in the sidebar to use a modern "Active Stripe" layout.
    - Active calendars are highlighted with a colored left border and a subtle background gradient using `color-mix`.
    - Inactive calendars fade out but show a visual preview on hover.
- **Logic**: The `active` state of calendars is now fully interactive. Clicking a calendar in the sidebar toggles its state and triggers a
  view refresh.
- **Data Fetching**: Added `calendarIds` (an array of currently active calendar IDs) to the `requestData` object in `fetchAppointments`.
    - This allows backend endpoints or the `url` callback function to filter appointments based on the active calendars.
- **Persistence**: Calendar active states are now persisted to `localStorage` (if `storeState` is enabled) and correctly restored upon
  initialization.
- **Normalization**: Improved validation for `settings.calendars`. It now robustly handles defaults for `title`, `color`, and sets `active`
  to `true` if undefined.

### Version 2.0.5

- Added: New utility function `convertIcsToAppointments(icsData)` to parse raw ICS strings into calendar-compatible appointment objects.
    - Supports standard properties: `SUMMARY` (mapped to `title`), `DESCRIPTION`, `LOCATION`, `UID`, `DTSTART`, `DTEND`.
    - Supports extended properties: `URL` (mapped to `link`), `CATEGORIES`, `STATUS`, `ORGANIZER`, and `ATTENDEE` (as array).
    - Automatically handles line unfolding (for long descriptions or broken lines).
    - Parses dates exactly as defined in the ICS string.

### Version 2.0.4

- Replaced `defaultColor` with `mainColor` for consistency in color settings.
- Enhanced layout flexibility with updated `flex-wrap` classes in navigation and top bar elements.
- Improved color application logic for holidays, appointments, and current-time indicators.
- Standardized `mainColor` utilization for day and month view rendering.
- Addressed minor layout inconsistencies in year view style definitions.
- Improved parameter documentation in `buildDayViewContent`.
- Enhanced layout handling with better defaults for hour labels and week view adjustments.
- Implemented half-hour dashed lines for rows meeting height criteria.
- Added clearer time slot metadata and consistent styling for grid rows.
- Included current-time indicator logic for the 'today' view.

### Version 2.0.3

Breaking/Structural

- Introduced stable, per-instance element IDs under `data.elements` (e.g., `wrapperId`, , , , ) and refactored DOM
  queries to use these IDs. This reduces selector collisions and improves multi-instance and re-init stability.
  `wrapperTopNavId``wrapperSideNavId``wrapperSearchNavId``wrapperViewContainerId``wrapperViewContainerTitleId``wrapperSmallMonthCalendarId``wrapperSmallMonthCalendarTitleId`

Improvements

- Re-initialization and state flow
    - `init()` now writes/reads `view`, `date`, and `searchMode` through the central data object and assigns a unique
      `data-bs-calendar-id` from `data.elements.wrapperId`.
    - `buildFramework()` constructs a deterministic layout using the new IDs and integrates / at explicit anchor points.
      `topbarAddons``sidebarAddons`
    - `setCurrentDateName()` and `buildByView()` now update titles/containers via per-instance IDs for reliable
      rendering.

- Safer destroy lifecycle
    - Centralized modal selector via `globalCalendarElements.infoModal`.
    - More defensive cleanup of namespaced events, aborting outstanding requests, removing classes/attributes, and
      disposing/removing the modal.
    - Restores original wrapper attributes via `restoreWrapperState()` and clears plugin data to avoid leaks.

- Search UX
    - `toggleSearchBar()` now toggles instance-scoped elements by ID (prevents cross-instance interference).
    - Search result rendering/pagination continues to work with instance-aware containers.

- Mini month calendar
    - `buildMonthSmallView()` renders into ID-scoped containers and highlights the active date from the central data
      object.
    - Year view consistently delegates to the mini month builder per month and provides badge placeholders.

- Debuggability
    - Added structured logs in `init()`, `buildByView()`, `fetchAppointments()`, and week-range calculations.

Fixes

- View container targeting: `getViewContainer()` uses an instance ID, fixing collisions with multiple calendars on the
  same page.
- Title/labels: `setCurrentDateName()` selects and updates the correct title nodes by ID; resolves inconsistent header
  updates.
- Sidebar animation/resizing: `handleSidebarVisibility()` targets the per-instance sidebar by ID and updates layout in
  month view reliably.
- Event containment: Namespaced body/document/window handlers combined with instance-aware selectors reduce
  cross-instance event handling.

Developer Notes

- If external code relied on class-based selectors inside the calendar, prefer instance-scoped selectors or the public
  API/events.
- When injecting addons (, ), ensure the selectors resolve within the new, ID-based framework structure.

#### **Version 2.0.2**

- Fix: week/period calculation (week view)
    - Fixed a bug where the calculated end date of the week was determined incorrectly (too far into the following
      month)
      at the change of month.
    - Cause: endDate was incorrectly modified based on the originally set Date object instead of being recalculated as a
      copy of startDate. As a result, weeks that protrude into the previous month resulted in a "rolling" of the day (e.g., 27.10. ⇒
      03.12.).
    - Fix: endDate is now explicitly copied from startDate and then added +6 days (endDate = new Date(
      startDate.getTime()); endDate.setDate(startDate.getDate() + 6)).

- Fix: Protection against unintentional overwriting of period parameters by queryParams
    - When merging the values returned by settings queryParams, period-related keys (fromDate, toDate, year, view) are
      now
      protected by default and not overwritten.
    - This keeps the UI calculation of the visible period consistent with the data queries.

- Improvement: Defensive Copies & Debug Logs
    - getStartAndEndDateByView now always uses copies of the internal date (avoiding side effects due to reference
      mutations).
    - Additional debug logs have been added (computed start/end data, requestData before/after queryParams) to make it
      easier to find errors when determining the query periods.

-Result:

- Appointments are now correctly placed within the rendered week, even at the change of month.
- Fewer error messages such as "Full-width container ... not found".
- Better debugging for a future time period and request issues.

#### **Version 2.0.0**

- Removed many features for Bootstrap 4 support.

#### **Version 1.2.12**

- Add: totalMinutes and totalSeconds to an appointment extras object

#### **Version 1.2.11**

- Update: readme
- Add: util function `getAppointmentTimespanBeautify`

#### **Version 1.2.9**

- Add configurable `showAddButton` option.

#### **Version 1.2.8**

- Fix: Normalize and deduplicate settings views after merging defaults, data-attributes, and passed options to avoid
  duplicating view entries in the view dropdown (prevents rendering the same view multiple times).
- Fix: Ensure settings views accept comma-separated strings and invalid values gracefully (falls back to sensible
  defaults).
- Improvement: Replace the locale-dependent "KW" week label with a language-neutral compact week label ("W42") for UI, store
  ISO week ("YYYY-Www") in a data-attribute, and add a localized date-range tooltip for better international clarity.

#### **Version 1.2.7**

- Fixed an issue where clicks inside the modal could trigger unintended calendar interactions or events. User actions on
  modal controls (inputs, buttons, etc.) are now isolated and no longer propagate unwanted events to the calendar view.

#### **Version 1.2.6**

##### **Changed**

- Extended the `formatter.allDay` function:  
  The callback now supports additional parameters to provide more flexibility when customizing the all-day area in the
  week view. Existing implementations remain compatible, but developers can now access more detailed context if needed.

##### **Docs**

- The documentation for the `formatter` option has been updated:
    - The description for `allDay` now reflects the possible new parameters and their structure.

  Example (in table format):

  | **Property** | **Type**   | **Params**                  | **Description**                                                       | 
                    |--------------|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | **allDay**   | `function` | (appointment, extras, view) | Customizes the rendering of the all-day area in weekly or daily view. |

#### **Version 1.2.4**

##### **Added**

- **Feature**: Appointment creation in the **Month View**:
    - Users can now effortlessly add appointments by clicking on a specific day in the calendar's month view.
    - This enhancement improves usability and streamlines the process of scheduling events directly from the calendar
      interface.

  **Technical Details:**
    - A click event on elements with `data-role="day-wrapper"` triggers a new appointment dialog.
    - The selected date is automatically populated in the appointment form.

  **Example:**
  ```javascript
  $('#calendar').on('add.bs.calendar', function (event, data) {
      console.log('New appointment created:', data);
  });
  ```

#### **Version 1.2.3**

##### **Added**

- **New Setting**: `settings.onAfterLoad`:
    - A new callback triggered after appointment loading has completed.
    - Receives the newly loaded appointments as parameters for additional processing.
- **New Event**: `after-load.bs.calendar`:
    - Introduced a jQuery event that fires after the calendar has finished loading appointments.
    - The new appointments are passed as parameters, enabling dynamic handling of loaded data.

#### **Version 1.2.2**

##### **Added**

- **Utils Integration**:
    - Introduced `openHolidayApi` utility to handle holiday-related external API integrations, including:
        - `getSubdivisions`: Fetch subdivisions based on country and language ISO codes.
        - `getLanguages`: Retrieve supported languages by country.
        - `getCountries`: Fetch country data.
        - `getSchoolHolidays`: Fetch school holidays for specified regions and dates.
        - `getPublicHolidays`: Retrieve public holidays based on ISO codes, region, language, and timeframes.
- **Date and Time Utils**:
    - Added utilities for date and time processing:
        - `formatTime`: Formats a `Date` object or string to a time string (`HH:mm:ss` or `HH:mm`).
        - `formatDateToDateString`: Converts a date to the SQL `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
        - `getCalendarWeek`: Calculates ISO 8601-compliant week numbers for a given date.
        - `getShortWeekDayNames`: Returns an array of shortened weekday names based on a locale.
        - `datesAreEqual`: Checks if two dates are equal by year, month, and day.
- **Dynamic Style Computation**: Added `computeColor` and `getComputedStyles` utilities to handle dynamic CSS
  class-based style computation.
- **Color Handling**: Implemented `colorNameToHex` for CSS color name to hex mapping.

##### **Changed**

- **Default Options**:
    - Improved flexibility with new configuration options:
        - `hourSlots`: Added new configuration for customizing the day/week view with parameters like `start`, `end`,
          and `height`.
        - `on*` Events: Expanded events (`onInit`, `onAdd`, `onEdit`, etc.) for granular handling of UI actions like
          event additions, deletions, calendar-view changes, etc.
- **Formatter Views**: Added support for holiday and duration display customization.

##### **Fixed**

- Error handling for invalid inputs in functions like API calls and date utilities.
- Validation of default configurations, ensuring fallbacks for undefined or null settings.

##### **Removed**

- Redundant or outdated methods that overlapped with newer, more efficient utilities.
